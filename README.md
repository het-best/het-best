# 👋 About me
Hi, I'm just some random, stupid guy, who thinks he is programmer.<br><br>

## My programming history
I am programming from 2020, first I was creating some basic pages in html, css and js.<br>
After that I tryed c++, but I don't liked it, so I started learning java.<br>
Than I tryed C# and learnt it pretty good but for some reason(I don't remember now) I .<br>
I also didn't liked java and tryed Python.<br>
And in the end I come back to c++ and it's my main language now.

## My magnum opus
I always wanted to create games, first I tryed Unity, then Godot.<br>
I made a couple games with Godot, but they weren't good in any way.<br>
Then in my stupid head came an idea "I can create my own engine!" and from around 2022-2023 I am working on [Real Engine](https://github.com/het-best/Real-Engine).<br>
It is a voxel game engine, made on c++ using OpenGL, glm, sfml and other stuff.

## 🏆Achievements
Not too much, just yet!<br>
But I won polish CTF called [Hack4Krak](https://hack4krak.pl) with a team of 4 other classmates in 2025, our team was called "Mokre smerfy" (Wet Smurfs on english).
